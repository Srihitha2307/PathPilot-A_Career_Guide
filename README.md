## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to choose careers that match their education, skills, and interests. Information is scattered, generic, and unreliable, making research confusing and time‑consuming. Without clear, personalized guidance, they risk poor decisions, missed opportunities, and uncertainty about costs, prospects, and long‑term growth.

## Key Challenges
- Matching skills, subjects, and interests to suitable careers  
- Researching scattered and unreliable information sources  
- Limited access to curated guidance on colleges, courses, resources, and internships  
- Uncertainty about costs, difficulty levels, and future prospects

## Project Objectives (Summary)
- Provide personalized career path recommendations  
- Offer detailed guidance on colleges, courses, costs, and job prospects  
- Reduce research time with curated resources and verified links  
- Help students make confident, informed decisions  

## Functional & Non-Functional Requirements (Summary)
- **Modules**:  
  1. User Profiling (collects education, skills, interests, budget, preferences)  
  2. Career Recommendation Engine (suggests 3–10 tailored career options with fit scores)  
  3. Career Path Information (detailed guidance on colleges, resources, internships, costs)  

- **Non-Functional Highlights**:  
  - Fast performance (recommendations in 2–3 seconds)  
  - Secure (encrypted data, role-based access)  
  - Scalable and reliable (99% uptime, backups, recovery)  
  - User-friendly, accessible, and compatible across devices
